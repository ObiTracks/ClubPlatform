<div>Some Text</div>
<p>Some Text</p>
<h1>Some Text</h1>
...
<h6>Some Text</h6>

Though some of these tags are just presets which are slight variations of each other (and that you'll probalby ignore anyway once you apply your own styling to your designs) when it comes to other interactions on a webpage like submitting forms or other interactive elements like buttons or the hyperlinks (the <a> tag), some tags have other actions and functionalities attached to them without you needing to add attributes. For example, the form tag is configured so that if you put a button inside of it to submit the form information, it automatically knows to submit the data from the form that its inside of without you having to do anything (its also possible to specify a form from outside too FYI). Another for example is the hyperlink <a> tag - it has some default styling, and automatically sets the default url to the current page (which you can and should change with its href attribute). The bottom line is that there are a lot of tags that just have a little preset styling, but you'll 9/10 times ignore to apply your own styling, and other tags that need to be used to have certain functionality in your page.

With css, its important to know this is something you learn just by doing repeatedly and overtime sticks in your head. you can definitely have some kind of cheat sheet (which can be really helpful often), but the more css you write, the more you remeber certain attribute names, ways to select specific items, and how to arrange items. That being said, there are several tools to make coding in html and css wayyy faster, and you can get almost these coding and typing shortcuts from extensions on vscode

What is an almost necessary built in css set of styling instructions for designing modern pages (especially quickly and easily) is a built in way to use css called CSS Flexbox. Its a set of predefined styling rules that allow you to quickly arrange groups or inidividual items implicitly (sorry for the big word - it just means without knowing how many items there are in advance, the styling rules will figure out how to arrange the items). This way you can arrange items in lists or groups with only a few lines of code.

Another built in way to use Flexbox is CSS Grid, which gives you the ability to make adjustable and in some cases fluid grid layouts in css. You can specify columns and rows (even repeating ones or automatically generated ones), and even name specific areas then tell an element the grid area its assigned to and it will fit that region. These are both very important to at least know the basics of. It will get you off your feet with styling much faster than using the bare-bones basics of CSS.

Fortunately for you, there is a great website that I use almost everytime I need a refresher on CSS since its almost like a cheat sheet - a website called CSS tricks https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/
